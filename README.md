# Azure VMware Solution Repository

The Azure VMware Solution product group has created this GitHub repository to share prescriptive architectural approaches and tools for customers and partners using the Azure VMware Solution service. This is intended to enhance the value of the Azure VMware Solution service to our customers and partners.

Use the [Table of Contents](#table-of-contents) section below to jump to the README.md file of the solution you are interested in. These solutions have been peer reviewed but are best-effort and should be assessed and tested by the customer before using in an Azure VMware Solution production environment.
